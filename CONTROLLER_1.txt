The code is written for the PIC18F4550 microcontroller. Here's a breakdown of each line:

#include <PIC18F4550.h>: This line includes the necessary header file for the PIC18F4550 microcontroller.

void main(): The main function is the entry point of the program.

unsigned int a = 8, b = 3, c = 0;: Three unsigned integer variables a, b, and c are declared and initialized with values 8, 3, and 0 respectively.

LATB = 0;: The LATB (Latch B) register is set to 0, ensuring that all output pins of Port B are initially low.

TRISB = 0;: The TRISB (Tri-state B) register is set to 0, configuring Port B as an output port.

c = a + b;: The values of a and b are added together, and the result is stored in variable c.

PORTB = c;: The value of c is written to the PORTB (Port B) register, which sets the output pins of Port B accordingly.

PORTC = a;: The value of a is written to the PORTC (Port C) register, which sets the output pins of Port C accordingly.

PORTD = b;: The value of b is written to the PORTD (Port D) register, which sets the output pins of Port D accordingly.

The purpose of this code is to perform some simple calculations and display the results on the corresponding ports. The result of a + b is displayed on Port B, a is displayed on Port C, and b is displayed on Port D.
