Here's a breakdown of each line:

#include <PIC18F4550.h>: This line includes the necessary header file for the PIC18F4550 microcontroller.

int main(): The main function is the entry point of the program. It returns an integer value.

int i;: An integer variable i is declared.

LATB = 0;: The LATB (Latch B) register is set to 0, ensuring that all output pins of Port B are initially low.

TRISB = 0;: The TRISB (Tri-state B) register is set to 0, configuring Port B as an output port.

int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};: An integer array arr is declared and initialized with 5 elements: 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5.

int arr1[5] = {0, 0, 0, 0, 0};: An integer array arr1 is declared and initialized with 5 elements, all set to 0.

for (i = 0; i < 5; i++): A for loop is used to iterate over the elements of the array. The loop runs from 0 to 4.

arr1[i] = arr[i];: Within the loop, each element of the arr array is assigned to the corresponding element in the arr1 array.

return 0;: The main function returns 0 to indicate successful program execution.

The purpose of this code is to copy the elements of the arr array into the arr1 array. It initializes the Port B settings, declares two arrays, and uses a for loop to iterate through each element of arr and assign it to the corresponding element in arr1.
